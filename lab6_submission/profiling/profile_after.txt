# Profiling Results - After Optimization

## Optimizations Applied

TODO: Document what you changed

Example optimizations to consider:
1. Better data structure for visited states
   - Before: set of tuples
   - After: dictionary with custom key
2. Reduce redundant computations
   - Before: Recalculating time windows on each visit
   - After: Cache time window checks
3. More efficient priority queue
   - Before: heapq with tuple comparison
   - After: heapq with custom State class

## Performance Improvement

TODO: Fill in actual measurements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total runtime | ___ ms | ___ ms | __% |
| heappush calls | ___ | ___ | __% |
| heappop calls | ___ | ___ | __% |
| Memory usage | ___ MB | ___ MB | __% |

## Profiling Output After Optimization

TODO: Paste actual cProfile output here

Expected improvements:
- Reduced time in bottleneck function
- Fewer unnecessary function calls
- Better cache hit rates (if applicable)

## Goal: At Least 20% Speedup

Target: If baseline was 100ms, optimized should be ≤80ms

If you cannot achieve 20%:
- Document what you tried
- Explain why it didn't work
- Discuss alternative approaches
- Partial credit available for well-reasoned attempts
